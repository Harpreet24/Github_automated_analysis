# GitHub Automated Analysis

This project is a Python-based tool built with Streamlit and GPT to find the most technically challenging repository from a GitHub user's profile.

Step 1: Set up the project
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line.

Step 2: Initialize a virtual environment (optional)
To keep your project dependencies isolated, you can create a virtual environment. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv":

## python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

## # For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# For macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Step 3: Install the required packages
Install Streamlit and other necessary packages using pip:
## pip install streamlit openai requests

Step 4: Create the main Python file
In your project directory, create a file named app.py and add the following code:

Step 5: Create a requirements.txt file
In your project directory, create a file named requirements.txt and add the following lines:

##  streamlit 
##  openai 
##  requests
